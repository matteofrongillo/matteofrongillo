# Hello, I'm Matteo!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate learner with a deep interest in energy efficiency, environmental engineering, MEP engineering, and programming.

## About me

- I am currently studying Energy and Environmental Engineering at HSLU;
- I have a background as a 2D and 3D-BIM MEP designer, with a focus on heating systems;
- I have experience in university research, particularly in 3D-BIM modeling of BIPV and BAPV photovoltaic panels, as well as energy-efficient urban redevelopment projects aimed at zero-emission
  buildings;
- I've been playing the drums for almost 15 years, and I’m a big fan of rock music.

## Skills

- LaTeX for writing school notes;
- Experience in 3D-BIM modeling and sustainable urban development;
- Proficient in AutoCAD and REVIT, with perfect knowledge of both programs;
- Experience in MEP engineering and design.

## Goals

- Expand my knowledge in energy efficiency and environmental pollution control;
- Gain more experience in projects focused on minimizing air and water pollution;
- Collaborate on projects related to Energy and Environmental engineering and MEP engineering.

## Get in touch

Feel free to reach out to me if you’d like to collaborate or discuss energy efficiency, 3D-BIM MEP and design models, or interesting problems!
